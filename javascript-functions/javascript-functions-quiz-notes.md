## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A function is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  When defining a function we have to give the _function_ keyword. Then zero or more parameters are listed. This is followed by the code block and an optional return statement.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  Once a function is defined, it can be called.When the function is called, the code within the code block is ran.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  When functions are called, it uses the name of the function followed by parentheses (). TThis uses the code block within the functions definition to be executed.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  Parameters are placeholders that is known known until we call a function and pass an argument. When is function is called and the code block is ran, the parameter will hold the argument.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Parameters are useful because it does not limit the function to one argument.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  It causes the function to produce a value that we can use and it prevents any more code in the functions code from being run.
