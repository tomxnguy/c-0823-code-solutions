- What is the `className` property of element objects?
  className property is used to set the value of the class attribute of an element

- How do you update the text within an element using JavaScript?
  assigning a new value to the textContent property.

- Is the `event` parameter of an event listener callback always useful?
  most times it is because it can be used for the handler function to know about that event had happened

- Would this assignment be simpler or more complicated if we didn't use a variable to keep track of the number of clicks?
  It would be more complicated because we would have to go into the DOM in order to track the number of clicks.

- Why is storing information about a program in variables better than only storing it in the DOM?
  its easier to manipulate data in a variable compared to a DOM. Retrieving data from a DOM would be slower too because it would have to go through the entire DOM in order to find the data that we want.
