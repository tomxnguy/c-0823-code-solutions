## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?
  Destructuring is a way to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.

- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
  const {identifier} = expression

Object destructuring can be done on left hand side of the assignment. The identifier of before the colon is the property of the object and the identifier after the colon is the variable.

- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
  The syntax looks similar to array literals. The array literal on the left hand side of the assignments uses its position to extract data.

- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?
  The variable would be on the right side of the assignment operator.
